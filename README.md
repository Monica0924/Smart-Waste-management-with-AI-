# Smart-Waste-management-with-AI-
Bin to Win is a smart recycling system that encourages proper waste disposal by combining AI-based waste detection with a reward system. The project automatically classifies waste materials such as plastic, glass, metal, and paper using a webcam, and rewards users with cashback or points for correct disposal.
